# Introduction to MySQL, Creating Database & Other Operations

## 1. Introduction to MySQL
MySQL is an **open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** used to store and manage data. It uses **SQL (Structured Query Language)** for querying and manipulating data.

### 1.1 Why MySQL?
- Free and open-source
- Fast and reliable
- Supports large-scale applications
- Works on all major OS
- Supports multiple programming languages (PHP, Python, Java, etc.)
- Ideal for web applications

### 1.2 Characteristics of MySQL
- Multi-user architecture
- High performance
- Secure data protection
- Scalable storage
- Data integrity with constraints

### 1.3 Where MySQL Is Used?
- E-commerce (products, orders, payments)
- School/college management systems
- Social media platforms
- Banking systems
- Content management systems (WordPress)

## 2. Basic Concepts in MySQL

### 2.1 Database
A **database** is a collection of tables used to store information.

**Example:**
A `school` database may have tables like:
- `students`
- `teachers`
- `courses`

### 2.2 Table
A **table** stores data in rows and columns.

### 2.3 Row
A **row** is a single record in a table.

### 2.4 Column
A **column** represents a field with a datatype.

### 2.5 Primary Key
A unique identifier for each row.

### 2.6 Foreign Key
Links two tables together.

# 3. SQL vs MySQL

| SQL | MySQL |
|------|--------|
| A language for database operations | A database system that uses SQL |
| Used to query data | Stores and manages data |
| Not software | Full RDBMS software |

# 4. Creating a Database

## 4.1 Syntax
```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

## 4.2 Example
```sql
CREATE DATABASE school;
```

## 4.3 Use a Database
```sql
USE school;
```

---

# 5. Creating Tables

## 5.1 Syntax
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_name datatype constraints
);
```

## 5.2 Example
```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    course VARCHAR(50)
);
```

---

# 6. Inserting Data

## 6.1 Syntax
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (columns) VALUES (values);
```

## 6.2 Example
```sql
INSERT INTO students (name, age, course)
VALUES ('Rahul Kumar', 20, 'BCA');
```

## 6.3 Insert Multiple Rows
```sql
INSERT INTO students (name, age, course)
VALUES
('Suman', 22, 'B.Tech'),
('Aman', 21, 'BBA'),
('Neha', 19, 'BCA');
```

---

# 7. Viewing Data (SELECT)

## 7.1 Select All
```sql
SELECT * FROM students;
```

## 7.2 Select Specific Columns
```sql
SELECT name, course FROM students;
```

## 7.3 Select with Condition
```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 20;
```

---

# 8. Updating Data

## 8.1 Syntax
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column=value WHERE condition;
```

## 8.2 Example
```sql
UPDATE students SET course = 'MCA' WHERE id = 1;
```

---

# 9. Deleting Data

## 9.1 Delete Specific Row
```sql
DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 2;
```

## 9.2 Delete All Rows
```sql
DELETE FROM students;
```

---

# 10. Alter Table (Add, Modify, Drop Columns)

## 10.1 Add Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE students ADD email VARCHAR(100);
```

## 10.2 Modify Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE students MODIFY age SMALLINT;
```

## 10.3 Drop Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE students DROP COLUMN email;
```

---

# 11. Dropping Tables & Databases

## 11.1 Drop Table
```sql
DROP TABLE students;
```

## 11.2 Drop Database
```sql
DROP DATABASE school;
```

---

# 12. Complete Workflow Example

## Step 1: Create Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE company;
USE company;
```

## Step 2: Create Employees Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    salary INT,
    department VARCHAR(50)
);
```

## Step 3: Insert Data
```sql
INSERT INTO employees (emp_name, salary, department)
VALUES ('Surya Mani', 50000, 'IT');
```

## Step 4: View Data
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

## Step 5: Update Data
```sql
UPDATE employees SET salary = 55000 WHERE emp_id = 1;
```

## Step 6: Delete Record
```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE emp_id = 1;
```
