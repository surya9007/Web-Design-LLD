# Passing by Value and Passing by Reference

## 🧩 Introduction
In PHP, when you pass variables to a function, you can do so **by value** or **by reference**.  
Understanding the difference between these two methods is crucial for writing efficient and bug-free code.

## 🔹 Passing by Value
When a variable is **passed by value**, a **copy** of the variable’s value is passed to the function.  
This means any changes made inside the function **do not affect** the original variable.

### ✅ Example:
```php
<?php
function addFive($num) {
    $num += 5;
    echo "Inside function: $num<br>";
}

$number = 10;
addFive($number);
echo "Outside function: $number";
?>
```

### 🧠 Output:
```
Inside function: 15
Outside function: 10
```
**Explanation:**  
The `$number` variable outside the function remains unchanged because the function works on a copy.

## 🔸 Passing by Reference
When a variable is **passed by reference**, the function receives a **reference** (or alias) to the original variable.  
Any changes made inside the function **will affect** the original variable.

### ✅ Example:
```php
<?php
function addFiveRef(&$num) {
    $num += 5;
    echo "Inside function: $num<br>";
}

$number = 10;
addFiveRef($number);
echo "Outside function: $number";
?>
```

### 🧠 Output:
```
Inside function: 15
Outside function: 15
```

**Explanation:**  
The `&` symbol before `$num` tells PHP to use **passing by reference**.  
Thus, the original variable `$number` is modified directly.

## 🔍 Key Differences

| Feature | Passing by Value | Passing by Reference |
|----------|------------------|----------------------|
| What is passed? | Copy of the value | Reference (address) of variable |
| Affects original variable? | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Syntax | Normal variable | Add `&` before parameter |
| Use case | When you don’t want to change the original value | When you want to modify the original variable |

## ⚙️ Example: Swap Function

### Passing by Value ❌
```php
<?php
function swap($a, $b) {
    $temp = $a;
    $a = $b;
    $b = $temp;
}

$x = 5;
$y = 10;
swap($x, $y);
echo "x = $x, y = $y";
?>
```
**Output:**
```
x = 5, y = 10
```

### Passing by Reference ✅
```php
<?php
function swapRef(&$a, &$b) {
    $temp = $a;
    $a = $b;
    $b = $temp;
}

$x = 5;
$y = 10;
swapRef($x, $y);
echo "x = $x, y = $y";
?>
```
**Output:**
```
x = 10, y = 5
```
